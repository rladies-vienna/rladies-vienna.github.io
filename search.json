How to do that? Do you put the project in some sort of box? In this talk I will present tools that are good to know: git, here, renv, targets, orderly … I’ll also report whether making an R package out of everything is always a good idea. After this presentation you will have learnt tips and tricks to apply as you like in your R projects. I hope every one of you will learn at least one new thing!”\nWe are so happy to have Maëlle contribute to our Meetup!

One way to communicate space and time information together is through a glyph map where temporal coordinates are transformed into space.

Books, in particular, can have considerable influence, as their characters serve to shape role models of femininity and masculinity for young children. Thus, gender under- and misrepresentation in children’s textual literature can contribute to the internalization and reinforcement of stereotypes. To address this issue, we aim to identify and measure relevant dimensions of gender bias in children’s books with the aid of both qualitative and quantitative techniques: systematic literature review across disciplines on the one hand and natural language processing (NLP) methods on the other. By exploiting such an integrated research framework, we believe that it is possible to automate the detection of potentially biased text while enhancing the interpretability and transparency of the results.\n\n\n\nSpeaker\nFlorian Schwendinger, Camilla Damian\nRSVP via Meetup"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nWithin and across organisations, groups are formed to tackle situations that require a decision or recommendation to be made, whether the situation is simple or complex, routine or one-off, short or long-term. However, inconsistencies between group members’ definitions of the situation often gives rise to conflict. Within the management and system sciences, various model-driven support approaches have been developed to assist groups in revealing disagreements and managing conflict. In this study, we investigate whether the preference for deliberate and deep information processing, also known as epistemic motivation, affects an important feature of model-driven group decision support. It serves as an aid to surface and manage cognitive conflict within the group. We report on an experimental study that adopts a process-oriented methodology to examine conflict management behaviors and trajectories of groups with different levels of epistemic motivation. Using TraMineR: Sequence Analysis Toolkit, we show how conflict management trajectories are influenced by epistemic motivation of groups. The results indicate that three dimensions of epistemic motivation; discomfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, preference for order and structure are significant co-variates of variance in groups’ conflict management trajectories."

Our contribution consists of two parts: first, the introduction of our R package, developed using the “Open API generator,” enabling seamless querying of our database via a RESTful API. Additionally, we show the integration of a robust authorization and authentication layer within AWS cloud infrastructure. Second, we have designed a user-friendly R/Shiny-based frontend to facilitate easy access for non-technical users. This interface displays forecasts and historic data for various variables and countries, allowing for data updates and downloads. To mimic familiar Excel operations such as row-wise pasting and data removal, we have successfully utilized the open-source R-wrapper rhandsontable of the JavaScript library handsontable. Both contributions enable our analysts and clients to smoothly interact with our database by providing a convenient, secure, and user-friendly environment, enhancing the accessibility of our macroeconomic data for all stakeholders."

Bring along your laptop to follow the presented examples and for some hands-on exercises!\nCluster analysis groups data based on similarities without relying on predefined labels, making it valuable in marketing, healthcare, social media and fraud detection. Unlike classification, which uses labelled data to assign data points to predefined categories, clustering works with unlabelled data to reveal hidden patterns.\nCluster validation ensures that the groups identified are meaningful using metrics such as compactness and separation, while visualisation tools such as scatter plots and dendrograms help to interpret the results. Common methods such as K-means, hierarchical clustering and model-based approaches are tailored to different data structures and objectives.\n\n\nSpeaker\nTheresa Scharl-Hirsch\nRSVP via Meetup"

    "section": "Abstract",
    "text": "Abstract\nRandom projection is a powerful and important tool for dimensionality reduction where a set of high-dimensional points is linearly mapped onto a lower dimension. Random projection matrices can be rapidly generated and are oblivious to the data distribution, maintain interpretability and are equipped with theoretical guarantees on preserving the geometry of the original space with a high probability. When employed in a supervised setting, they can provide a significant reduction in computational cost. However, they tend to overfit so it is desirable to first eliminate the unimportant predictors and then perform the random projection and estimate the model on the space of the reduced (i.e., projected) predictors. Moreover, to reduce the uncertainty from the random projection, ensembles can be built. In this work we propose an R package which implements a variety of random projection and screening tools for regression in high-dimensional settings. The functionality of the package is presented using simulated and real data examples."
