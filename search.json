How to do that? Do you put the project in some sort of box? In this talk I will present tools that are good to know: git, here, renv, targets, orderly … I’ll also report whether making an R package out of everything is always a good idea. After this presentation you will have learnt tips and tricks to apply as you like in your R projects. I hope every one of you will learn at least one new thing!”\nWe are so happy to have Maëlle contribute to our Meetup! See you soon online!"

She will introduce us to the cubble package and walk us through how we can work with spatial data and temporal data in R, and how we can more easily combine the two using cubble.\n\nAbstract\nWeather data have a spatial component given by the station coordinates and a temporal component that provides measurements on precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature. This will be a hand-on session to work with weather station data. We will use the package sf to work on the spatial side to generate some maps and the package tsibble to conduct some exploratory data analysis on the temporal side. One way to communicate space and time information together is through a glyph map where temporal coordinates are transformed into space. We will create the glyph map with the ggplot geom: geom_glyph(). Lastly, we will experiment with a new data structure, cubble, to arrange spatio-temporal data."

We will hear two presentations:\n\nFlorian Schwendinger: Introduction to NLP in R\nCamilla Damian: Detecting Gender Bias in Children’s Books\nFlo will first give a general overview of the topic and show relevant R packages (see also the CRAN Task View on the topic of NLP).\nThis will be followed by an application described by Camilla: Gender stereotypes form early in the child’s development and are carried over throughout adolescence into adulthood, leaving long-lasting effects which may impact activity and career choices, as well as academic performance. Books, in particular, can have considerable influence, as their characters serve to shape role models of femininity and masculinity for young children. Thus, gender under- and misrepresentation in children’s textual literature can contribute to the internalization and reinforcement of stereotypes. To address this issue, we aim to identify and measure relevant dimensions of gender bias in children’s books with the aid of both qualitative and quantitative techniques: systematic literature review across disciplines on the one hand and natural language processing (NLP) methods on the other. By exploiting such an integrated research framework, we believe that it is possible to automate the detection of potentially biased text while enhancing the interpretability and transparency of the results."

She will present How groups manage conflict when using model-driven decision support: Sequence Analysis using TraMineR, shared work with L. Alberto Franco and Etiënne A.J.A. Rouwette.\nFollowing the presentation we are happy to invite you to a small buffet and some drinks, sponsored by the University of Vienna.\n\nAbstract\nWithin and across organisations, groups are formed to tackle situations that require a decision or recommendation to be made, whether the situation is simple or complex, routine or one-off, short or long-term. However, inconsistencies between group members’ definitions of the situation often gives rise to conflict. Within the management and system sciences, various model-driven support approaches have been developed to assist groups in revealing disagreements and managing conflict. In this study, we investigate whether the preference for deliberate and deep information processing, also known as epistemic motivation, affects an important feature of model-driven group decision support. It serves as an aid to surface and manage cognitive conflict within the group. We report on an experimental study that adopts a process-oriented methodology to examine conflict management behaviors and trajectories of groups with different levels of epistemic motivation. Using TraMineR: Sequence Analysis Toolkit, we show how conflict management trajectories are influenced by epistemic motivation of groups. The results indicate that three dimensions of epistemic motivation; discomfort with ambiguity, decisiveness, preference for order and structure are significant co-variates of variance in groups’ conflict management trajectories."

If these products and services are supposed to serve our society as a whole, we need a lot of diverse and creative perspectives reflecting the richness of our communities. Therefore, we strongly believe that striving to increase diversity among technologists should be a major goal.\nOn our pursuit for diversity, one of the most encouraging things we can do is to highlight those women who already work on great things within their respective industries, provide them platforms to share their knowledge and inspire by their example.\nIn Vienna, a range of initiatives promoting gender diversity in STEM (science, technology, engineering & math) exist. To increase visibility as well as to facilitate exchange of ideas and getting-to-know-each-other amongst these initiatives, a session solely dedicated to these groups and projects will take place during PyDays Vienna.\n\nEnlisted Initiatives\n\nCo-Mentoring Programme - Women in Data Science\nFeminist Python Meetup for Women* and Non-Binary Folks in Vienna\nFeminist Linux Meetup für Frauen*, Non-Binary*, Trans* und Inter* Personen\ndiebin.at - Verein zur Förderung emanzipatorischer Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien\nR-Ladies Vienna\nIEEE Women in Engineering\n\nPeople of all genders are welcome to attend our event.

We will explore how their new R package simplifies querying their centralized database through a secure AWS setup and discover their intuitive R/Shiny interface for easy data access and updates. They will showcase features like Excel-like operations via rhandsontable, designed to enhance usability for both technical and non-technical users. Perfect for analysts and clients looking to smoothly interact with macroeconomic data!\n\nAbstract\nHere is Ilaria’s and Mina’s abstract for the talk: As developers at a leading economic and financial markets research institution, centralizing our data is crucial for both internal (backtesting, sharing forecasts, model validations) and external (client access) use cases. Our contribution consists of two parts: first, the introduction of our R package, developed using the “Open API generator,” enabling seamless querying of our database via a RESTful API. Additionally, we show the integration of a robust authorization and authentication layer within AWS cloud infrastructure. Second, we have designed a user-friendly R/Shiny-based frontend to facilitate easy access for non-technical users. This interface displays forecasts and historic data for various variables and countries, allowing for data updates and downloads. To mimic familiar Excel operations such as row-wise pasting and data removal, we have successfully utilized the open-source R-wrapper rhandsontable of the JavaScript library handsontable. Both contributions enable our analysts and clients to smoothly interact with our database by providing a convenient, secure, and user-friendly environment, enhancing the accessibility of our macroeconomic data for all stakeholders."

Bring along your laptop to follow the presented examples and for some hands-on exercises!\nCluster analysis groups data based on similarities without relying on predefined labels, making it valuable in marketing, healthcare, social media and fraud detection. Unlike classification, which uses labelled data to assign data points to predefined categories, clustering works with unlabelled data to reveal hidden patterns.\nCluster validation ensures that the groups identified are meaningful using metrics such as compactness and separation, while visualisation tools such as scatter plots and dendrograms help to interpret the results. Common methods such as K-means, hierarchical clustering and model-based approaches are tailored to different data structures and objectives."

For our first event after the summer we will welcome our own Laura Vana-Gür who will talk about how we can use random projection for regression analysis in R using the package SPAR.\n\nAbstract\nRandom projection is a powerful and important tool for dimensionality reduction where a set of high-dimensional points is linearly mapped onto a lower dimension. Random projection matrices can be rapidly generated and are oblivious to the data distribution, maintain interpretability and are equipped with theoretical guarantees on preserving the geometry of the original space with a high probability. When employed in a supervised setting, they can provide a significant reduction in computational cost. However, they tend to overfit so it is desirable to first eliminate the unimportant predictors and then perform the random projection and estimate the model on the space of the reduced (i.e., projected) predictors. Moreover, to reduce the uncertainty from the random projection, ensembles can be built. In this work we propose an R package which implements a variety of random projection and screening tools for regression in high-dimensional settings. The functionality of the package is presented using simulated and real data examples."

    "text": "About\nIn a previous meetup our own Mari Plaza has presented an introduction of Golem which allows you for sure to write a ShinyApp with the production ready mind-set. That means writing a ShinyApp like a package, including all relevant components of Software Engineering such modules, tests, dependencies, git, code coverage and so on. In such way, your Web Application developed in R is like a ShinyApp and has the correct architecture to go to production. This time, we go beyond an introduction session for a 3 hours workshop, starting with 1 hour of presentation about how you plan your application, followed by 2 hours of practical experience on how you use golem.\nBring your computer and be ready to ask questions and test by yourself what we are talking about.\nSince the content is interesting and rather dense, you could join us in the preview activities starting at the end of February 2024, but you can always catch-up, even on the day of the event. The preview activities includes:\n\nJoin our SLACK dedicated channel for discussing the concepts and review related materials.\nFollow posts in our LinkedIn accounts.\nRegular updates through the messages of this event on MeetUp.\n\nWe are really happy to host this event with care and willingness to learn more about the great world of software engineering."

    "text": "About\nOur last meetup of the year will take place in a HYBRID format, both live at TU Wien and online via zoom. Please note the family friendly time slot during the lunch break. You do not need to specify in advance whether you will participate online or live, but we would be happy to see you in person at TU Wien if you are available.\nOur speaker is María Inés Plaza who will introduce us to golem, a package in R to develop production ready Shiny Apps. She will guide us through the content of the book Engineering Production Grade Shiny Apps and will share her experience developing apps with this package and methodology. This is a 100% interactive session where you could ask questions.\nSince most probably many details will not be covered in the talk due to time constraints, you could join Mari at the Data Science Cafe on 9th December at WeXelerate to go into more details.\nSee you soon!\nRSVP via Meetup"
