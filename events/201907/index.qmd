# About

As our last event before the summer, we would be happy if you join us for some drinks and networking next Tuesday on the Donaukanal at Summer Stage. It would be a great opportunity to get to know each other or simply catch up. We are looking forward to meeting you!

To those of you who can’t join, we wish you a happy summer! 

Next events will resume after the summer.
