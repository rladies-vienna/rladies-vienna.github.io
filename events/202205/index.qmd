## About

We are happy to announce the next series of Shiny workshops before the summer break!

[Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.

We will start with a kick-off event where we will have a brief intro to Shiny and set up groups which will work together on building an app. We will prepare a list of topic suggestions but participants are encouraged to bring their own use-cases.

The following session will be hands-on, where the teams will work on the app.

In the final session on June 23rd teams will have the chance to present their work and discuss on the experience.

The workshops will be held presence, finally!

All levels of R proficiency are welcome. See you soon!
