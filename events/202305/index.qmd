## About

We are happy to announce Bettina Grün and Benjamin Schwendinger as the speakers for our next joint event with the *ViennaR* meetup group!

Benjamin Schwendinger will talk about the `data.table` package, which is a widely used, high-performance extension of base R's `data.frame`. In this talk, we will cover the latest development steps of the package over the last few years. We will also shed light on how `data.table` gains its speed and how useRs can ensure that it is used to its full potential.

Bettina Grün will be giving a talk on R Packages, walking us through important guidelines for extending R with packages. This talk will be interesting for R package developers and useRs alike.
