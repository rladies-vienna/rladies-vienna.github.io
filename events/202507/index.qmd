As the last event before our summer break, we warmly invite you to a relaxed get-together where you can, for instance:

-   Connect with familiar and new faces in our community

-   Exchange ideas such as your recent R work or summer learning goals

-   Share your thoughts on our future meetups

All genders and identities are welcome. We look forward to seeing you at this meetup!
