## About

Our next meetup will take place live at TU Wien. Our speaker is Sherry Zhang who is visiting from Australia. She will introduce us to the `cubble` package and walk us through how we can work with spatial data and temporal data in R, and how we can more easily combine the two using `cubble`.

### Abstract

Weather data have a spatial component given by the station coordinates and a temporal component that provides measurements on precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature. This will be a hand-on session to work with weather station data. We will use the package `sf` to work on the spatial side to generate some maps and the package `tsibble` to conduct some exploratory data analysis on the temporal side. One way to communicate space and time information together is through a glyph map where temporal coordinates are transformed into space. We will create the glyph map with the ggplot geom: `geom_glyph()`. Lastly, we will experiment with a new data structure, `cubble`, to arrange spatio-temporal data.
