## About

We are happy to announce that for the May 2021 Meetup, our co-organizer Ursula Laa will offer a tutorial into data visualization with the R package `ggplot2`. 

Starting from the underlying principles of tidy data and the grammar of graphics, Ursula will introduce the basic ingredients (aesthetics and geoms), and show how to build a ggplot layer-by-layer. We will see together how we can quickly generate very different graphs with small changes in a standard interface, making it easy to better explore data.
