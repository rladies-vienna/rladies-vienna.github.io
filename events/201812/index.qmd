# About

As is tradition in Vienna during this time of the year, we decide to get together for some drinks in one of Vienna‘s beautiful Christmas markets.

We would love it if you join us. However, to those of you who won’t be able to make it, happy holidays and see you next year!

All the best and see you soon!
