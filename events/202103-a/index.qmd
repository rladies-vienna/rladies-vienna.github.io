## About

We are proud to announce the collaboration between *PyLadies Vienna* and *R-Ladies Vienna* for a series of events aimed at fostering the collaboration and synergies between our communities.

We invite you to join us for the first event of the series: Workshop on introduction to Python. Whether you are already proficient in R and want to gradually add Python to your portfolio, or want to learn some programming basics in a faster pace in a form of a lecture, this tutorial will serve as a starting point for your journey.

The agenda of the workshop will be: 

- Intro to Python - syntax, loop, functions 
- Basic data types and structures 
- Reading data 
- Examples and use cases

To be able to follow the course and try things yourselves, we recommend to install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). If you do not have a favorite code editor, we would suggest to install [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) else feel free to use what you like.

Can't wait to meet you and share some love for Python!

Both events are preliminary steps to our final event: Panel Discussion about conjunction of both worlds with PyLadies and R-Ladies on board, which will take place on 27.3.2021.

We also have a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/2387073381541947/) to share ideas or questions.
