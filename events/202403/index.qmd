## About

To complete topics that we did not manage to fit into the first workshop, we will host the second part of the Introduction to R Workshop in our next Meetup. This time we will cover:

-   Reading in data
-   Basic data visualization
-   R packages
-   R Markdown for writing reports

The workshop is open to everyone, in particular also if you did not make it to the first part! To catch up you can look at the first few sections of the workshop material prepared by Pia: Intro to R (up to the Data Structures section) or you could read through the Getting Started section of [ModernDive](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html).

As before, we recommend you bring your own laptop where you have [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) installed. In case you want to install [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com), you can follow the instructions from [R Markdown: The Definitive Guide](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/installation.html).
