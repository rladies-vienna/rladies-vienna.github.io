We are proud to announce the collaboration between *PyLadies Vienna* and *R-Ladies Vienna* for a series of events aimed at fostering the collaboration and synergies between our communities.

We invite you to join us for the second event of the series: Introduction to R Workshop. Whether you are just starting out your data analytics journey and want to learn some programming basics, or are a Python user who would like to add R to your skill set, this tutorial will serve as a starting point for your journey.

We are happy to welcome Camilla Damian as our trainer for this workshop, who will offer an interactive online tutorial where she will cover:

- Brief intro to R as a programming language 
- Data structures and functions 
- Reading data into R 
- Basic data visualization in R 
- Examples and use cases

We recommend you install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) before the start of the meetup.

See you soon online!
