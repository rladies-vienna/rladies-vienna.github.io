## Join our community

We prioritize the representation of gender minorities in our community, and at the same time welcome all identities to participate in our events.

Following the practice of the R-Ladies Global, we manage event registration through the Meetup platform. If you are interested in attending our events, please join our Meetup group and RSVP at the corresponding event pages.
